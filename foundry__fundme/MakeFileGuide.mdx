# Comprehensive Makefile Syntax Guide

## Basic Structure

A Makefile consists of rules in the following format:

```makefile
target: prerequisites
    commands
```

- `target`: The file to be created or the action to be carried out
- `prerequisites`: Files that the target depends on
- `commands`: Shell commands to create the target (must be indented with a tab)

## Variables

Variables are defined and used as follows:

```makefile
VARIABLE_NAME = value
ANOTHER_VAR := immediate value

use_var:
    echo $(VARIABLE_NAME)
    echo ${ANOTHER_VAR}
```

- `=` for recursive expansion
- `:=` for immediate expansion

## Automatic Variables

- `$@`: The target filename
- `$<`: The first prerequisite filename
- `$^`: The filenames of all prerequisites
- `$*`: The stem with which a pattern rule matches

## Pattern Rules

```makefile
%.o: %.c
    $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@
```

This rule compiles any `.c` file into a `.o` file.

## Phony Targets

```makefile
.PHONY: clean

clean:
    rm -f *.o
```

Phony targets are not files, but represent actions.

## Conditional Statements

```makefile
ifeq ($(CC),gcc)
    CFLAGS = -O2
else
    CFLAGS = -O
endif
```

Other conditionals: `ifneq`, `ifdef`, `ifndef`

## Functions

```makefile
FILES = $(wildcard *.c)
OBJS = $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(FILES))
```

Common functions:

- `wildcard`: Expand wildcards
- `patsubst`: Pattern substitution
- `shell`: Execute shell command
- `foreach`: Loop over list

## Include Other Makefiles

```makefile
include config.mk
```

## Suffix Rules (Deprecated but still used)

```makefile
.c.o:
    $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $<
```

This is equivalent to the pattern rule `%.o: %.c`

## Special Built-in Target Names

- `.PHONY`: Declare phony targets
- `.DEFAULT`: Default rule for unknown targets
- `.PRECIOUS`: Preserve intermediate files
- `.INTERMEDIATE`: Declare intermediate files
- `.SECONDARY`: Prevent intermediate files from being automatically deleted

## Multi-line Commands

Use `\` for line continuation:

```makefile
long_command:
    echo This is a very \
         long command that \
         spans multiple lines
```

## Error Handling

Use `-` before a command to ignore its error:

```makefile
clean:
    -rm temp_file
    echo "Cleaned"
```

## Parallel Execution

Use `-j` option when running make to enable parallel jobs:

```bash
make -j4
```

This guide covers the main syntax elements of Makefiles. Remember that Makefiles are sensitive to indentation, and commands under rules must be indented with a tab, not spaces.
